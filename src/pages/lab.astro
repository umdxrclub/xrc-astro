  <h1>The XR Lab</h1>
  <p>
    Need a place to chill to some cool VR games (like Beat Saber) and immersive
    experiences after a long day of classes? Looking to utilize powerful
    computers to build out your latest AR/VR idea and get some help
    troubleshooting your XR project? Want to brainstorm new ideas and chat about
    the future of XR with other members of the club? If so, then stop by the XR
    Lab (AVW 4176) for our Open Lab Hours for all your XR needs!
